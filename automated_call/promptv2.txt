Here are the instructions for how to play this game:
Find groups of four items that share something in common.

Categories share commonalities:
- There are 4 categories of 4 words each
- Every word will be in only 1 category
- One word will never be in two categories
- There will never be a miscellaneous category
- As the category number increases, the connections between the words and their category become more obscure. Category 1 is the most easy and intuitive and Category 4 is the hardest
- There may be a red herrings (words that seems to belong together but actually are in separate categories)
- Category 4 often contains compound words with a common prefix or suffix word
- A few other common categories include word and letter patterns, pop culture clues (such as music and movie titles) and fill-in-the-blank phrases

You will be given a new example(Example 4) with today’s list of words.First explain your reason for each category and then give your final answer following the structure below (Replace Category1,2,3,4 with their names instead):
Groupings:
Category1: [word1, word2, word3, word4]
Category2: [word5, word6, word7, word8]
Category3: [word9, word10, word11, word12]
Category4: [word13, word14, word15, word16]

Remember that the same word cannot be repeated across multiple categories, and you need to output 4 categories with 4 distinct words each. Also do not make up words not in the list. This is the most important rule. Please obey

Example 4:
Words : [InsertGame]
Groupings:
