"Here's my analysis and solution for Example 4:

* **Category 4:  Word pairs with a common sound** - Each pair forms a word when combined with the common sound ""to"".
    * **ATE, FOR, TOO, WON** 

**Explanation:**

1. **Category 1 (Redundancy):**  The words ""backup,"" ""copy,"" ""extra,"" and ""spare"" all suggest a duplicate or a reserve option, highlighting the concept of redundancy.

2. **Category 2 (Bowling):** This is a very straightforward category, as all the words are directly related to bowling.

    * ""Mug"" holds liquid, ""pen"" holds ink, ""tee"" holds a golf ball, and ""tote"" refers to a bag for carrying items.

4. **Category 4 (Word pairs with a common sound):**  This category requires a bit more thinking.  Each pair forms a word when you add the sound ""to"" before it:
    * ""to ate"" = ""to eat""
    * ""to for"" = ""to fore"" (as in a golf warning)
    * ""to too"" = ""too""
    * ""to won"" = ""to win""

* **Using all the words:**  Each word appears only once.
* **Avoiding miscellaneous categories:** Each group has a clear connection.
