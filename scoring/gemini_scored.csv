"Here's how I'd break down the words and find the categories:

**Reasoning:**

* **Category 1: **  ""Plant"" and ""Weed"" are obvious pairs, and ""Seed"" fits as well.  ""Green"" is likely the fourth.  These are all related to the world of flora.
* **Category 2:** ""Water,"" ""Way,"" and ""Wheel"" suggest travel or transportation. ""Whoa!"" as a command to stop fits this theme.
* **Category 3:** ""Pyramid,"" ""Caesar,"" and ""Greek"" all have a connection to Ancient Egypt and/or Ancient Greece.  ""Feud"" as a historical concept (e.g., the Hatfield-McCoy feud) makes sense here.
* **Category 4:**  This is the tricky one. ""Wedge"" is a tool. ""WEE"" and ""WHY"" are short words, with ""WHY"" asking a question. This suggests a category of ""small things that are asked about"". ""Millionaire"" fits as ""millionaires are rich"" which could be a question about wealth.

"Here's the breakdown of the categories and my solution for Example 4:

**Reasoning:**

* **Category 1:**  This category is typically the most straightforward, often involving direct synonyms or words that share a clear thematic connection.  Looking at the words, ""CHIP,"" ""SCRATCH,"" ""NICK,"" and ""DING"" all suggest minor imperfections or damages.
* **Category 2:**  This category often involves a slightly more abstract connection. ""RIGHT,"" ""YES,"" ""BINGO,"" and ""APPLE"" all represent positive outcomes or confirmations.  ""Right"" and ""Yes"" are direct confirmations, ""Bingo"" is a winning shout, and ""Apple"" is often used as a symbol for success (e.g., ""the apple of my eye"").
* **Category 3:**  This category requires a bit more thought and usually involves a word pattern or association. ""FLAP,"" ""WING,"" ""POPPER,"" and ""FRY"" all relate to cooking or food preparation. ""Flap"" can refer to chicken wings, ""Popper"" suggests a popcorn popper, and ""Fry"" is a common cooking method.
* **Category 4:**  This category is the most challenging and often involves obscure connections or compound words. ""CHIP,"" ""CRACKER,"" ""LUMBER,"" and ""NACHO"" all have the common element of ""**CR**"" within the word.
