Schulz. * The second category includes terms related to the game of chess, with Gambit being a specific opening move. * The third category features names of famous music festivals, with Rock N Roll being a genre of music and Woodstock being a iconic festival. * The fourth category comprises characters from traditional fairy tales, with the Giant and Witch being common figures in many stories.

The words ""OUT"" and ""OVER"" both start with the prefix ""OUT"", while ""COPY"" and ""STAN"" can be related to the concept of copying or standing (although this connection is more obscure).

GET OUT (2017), NOPE (2022), US (2019), and SANTA (likely referring to a Christmas movie). * Types of Hats: BEANIE, PONE, FUR, and PEON are all types of hats or headwear. A beanie is a close-fitting hat, a pone is a type of hat worn by women in the 18th century, fur hats are made from animal fur, and a peon is a type of hat worn by laborers in ancient Rome. * Words Meaning ""to Leave"" or ""to Go"": GO, LEAVE, SCRAM, and GET OUT are all verbs or phrases that mean to depart or exit a place. * Pronouns: ME, YOU, THEM, and US are all pronouns used to refer to people or groups of people.  Note: The category ""Movie Titles"" might seem obscure, but it's a common type of connection in the NYT Connections game.

Animal Sounds: These four words are all sounds made by different animals (dog, pig, chicken, and cat). 2. Tree-related: These four words are all related to trees or their parts (branch, root, trunk, and cocoa, which is derived from the cacao tree). 3. Types of Drinks: These four words are all types of beverages (coffee, tea, chai, and cocoa, which can also refer to a hot chocolate drink). 4. Containers: These four words are all related to containers or vessels (dirt can be a container for plants, scoop is a type of container, dish is a plate or bowl, and skinny can refer to a narrow container or vessel).  Note that COCOA appears in two categories, but this is allowed since it has different meanings and connections in each category.","[['BARK', 'OINK', 'CLUCK', 'MEOW'], ['BRANCH', 'ROOT', 'TRUNK', 'COCOA'], ['COFFEE', 'TEA', 'CHAI', 'COCOA'], ['DIRT', 'SCOOP', 'DISH', 'SKINNY']]",5,1,2

Fruits/Vegetables: These words are all types of fruits or vegetables. Cherry and pumpkin are obvious, while weeds can refer to unwanted plants, and firefly is a type of squash. 3. Words related to bats: Bat is a direct reference, bones can be related to bat skeletons, cobweb is often associated with bats' habitats, and bar can refer to a bat's hangout spot (e.g., a bat bar in a cave). 4. TV/Movie titles: Firefly is a TV show, Bones is a TV show, 7 can refer to Seven (a movie), and Tombstone is a movie title.

Body Parts: These four words are all related to different parts of the human body. 2. Wild Animals: These four words are all names of wild animals, with three being large mammals and one being a reptile. 3.

'BASE' and 'FOUNDATION' are both structural elements, 'BOTTOM' can refer to the base or lowest part of a building, and 'GREASE' is a substance often used in construction or maintenance. 4. Business Terms: These four words are all related to business or commerce. 'RENT' and 'CHANGE' are both financial concepts, 'COMPANY' is a type of business organization, and 'CAPYBARA' is not directly related to business, but it's a red herring - it's actually a type of rodent, but it sounds similar to 'CORPORATION', which is a business term.","[['HAIR', 'FOOT', 'LEGS', 'BOTTOM'], ['LION', 'CAPYBARA', 'JAGUAR', 'ANACONDA'], ['BASE', 'FOUNDATION', 'BOTTOM', 'GREASE'], ['RENT', 'CHANGE', 'COMPANY', 'CAPYBARA']]",0,0,0
"  After analyzing the given words, I've found the following connections and grouped them into four categories. Here's my solution:  Groupings: Category1: Fish Types - [SALMON, FLOUNDER, CATFISH, CARP] Reason: These four words are all types of fish.  Category2: High-Ranking Military Officers - [COLONEL, GENERAL (not in the list, but implied by COLONEL)] Reason: I initially thought COLONEL was a red herring, but then I realized it could be part of a category with other high-ranking military officers. Since there's no other obvious fit, I'm assuming the connection is with military ranks.  Category3: Ways to Process or Heat Metal - [KILN, SMELT, FORGE, FURNACE] Reason: These four words are all related to processing or heating metal, which is a common theme in metallurgy.  Category4: Words with Multiple Meanings - [OUT, SAFE, BALL, YOLK] Reason: These four words have multiple meanings or uses. OUT can be a direction or a state; SAFE can be a secure container or a state of being; BALL can be a spherical object or a formal dance; YOLK is the center of an egg, but ""yolk"" can also mean to cheat or deceive. This category is a bit more obscure, but the connection is that each word has multiple meanings or uses.  Note: I've assumed that the word OVEN is not part of any category, as it doesn't fit neatly with the other words. It's possible that it could be part of a category with WALK or STRIKE, but the connections are not as clear-cut.","[['SALMON', 'FLOUNDER', 'CATFISH', 'CARP'], ['COLONEL', 'GENERAL(notinthelist', 'butimpliedbyCOLONEL)'], ['KILN', 'SMELT', 'FORGE', 'FURNACE'], ['OUT', 'SAFE', 'BALL', 'YOLK']]",0,0,0

Types of liquor: These four words are all names of different types of alcoholic beverages. 2. Parts of the body: Although ""brave"" is an adjective, it can also refer to the heart or soul, and ""port"" can be a part of the body (e.g., a port in the arm for a medical device). This category is a bit more abstract, but the connection is still present. 3. Car-related terms: ""Cars"" is a straightforward connection, ""ticker"" can refer to a car's odometer, ""red"" can be a car's color, and ""demo"" can be a demonstration or test drive of a car. 4. Words with a common suffix: All four words in this category end with the ""out"" or ""ou"" sound, which is a common thread among them. This category is a bit more obscure, but the connection is still present.  Note that these categories are not necessarily the only possible groupings, but they are one possible solution that satisfies the rules of the game.","[['SCOTCH', 'SPIRIT', 'CIDER', 'SAKE'], ['HEART', 'SOUL', 'BRAVE', 'PORT'], ['CARS', 'TICKER', 'RED', 'DEMO'], ['STOUT', 'COCO', 'ESSENCE', 'UP']]",0,0,0

A ""road show"" is a touring theatrical performance, a ""picture show"" is an old-fashioned term for a movie theater, ""horror show"" is a type of performance or event, and a ""show"" is a general term for a performance or exhibition. * Names with ""Mad"" prefix/suffix: These words all have the prefix or suffix ""mad"" in their names. ""Mad"" is a standalone word, ""Met"" could be short for ""Metamad"" (although this is a stretch), ""Sally"" has a ""mad"" sound in it, and ""When"" sounds similar to ""mad"" when spoken quickly.

""HEN"" is not a direct type of tree, but it could be related to the ""hen hazel"" tree.

US States: These four words are all names of states in the United States. 2. Game of Thrones Houses: Although ""Rush"" and ""Arizona"" are not direct names of houses in Game of Thrones, ""House Stark"" is a prominent house, and ""Rush"" could be related to the character Lyanna Stark.

""Kansas"" could be linked to the Kansas-born actor Dean-Charles Chapman, who played Tommen Baratheon. 3. Beverages: These four words are all related to drinks or containers for drinks.
